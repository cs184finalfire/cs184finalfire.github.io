  Abstract
</h2>
  <p> <i>
    The main goal of this project was to attempt to experiment with new ways of simulating
    fire. State of the art fire simulations implement numerical integration of the PDEs
    that govern the motion and temperature of various gaseous substances involved in
    combustion, as well as highly sophistocated ray tracing techniques in order to
    properly render the fire. Our method allows a real-time simulation of fire
    using a randomized propagation method. The model we use is reminiscent of
    (and inspired by) interacting particle systems and random interface growth models from
    probability theory and statistical mechanics.

  <h2>
    Technical approach
  </h2>
  <h3> Background </h3>
    <p>
      Although our method ultimately was conceptually completely different,
      our group studied one of the most popular fire simulation methods
      to date, known as the level set method
       (cite Stam's stable fluids, and Stanford "physbam" people). For
      completeness, we outline the key steps in the method here.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simulation
      uses a 3-dimensional $N \times N \times N$ grid of voxels, embedded in world space
      with spacing $h$ between the centers
      of the grid-faces. The algorithm keeps track of the level set function, $\phi$,
      the pressure, $p$, and the temperature $T$ at the centers
      of the voxels. The algorithm also keeps track of velocity fields and densities
      for two different substances -- the fuel (inside the burning fire),
      and the hot gaseous products (in the ambient air).
      The main idea is to update the function $\phi$ so that the interface between
      the two different substances (ie the two dimensional surface
      which is the outer boundary of the flame) is given by the level set
      $\phi = 0$.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, at each step of the algorithm the function $\phi$ is
      updated so that the level surface propogates correctly,
      and also such that it, at least approximately,
       satisfies the property $| \nabla \phi | = 1$. Further,
      for both the fuel and the hot gasses the algorithm
      updates the velocity and pressure fields so as to ensure that each
      substance separately satisfies its own set of incompressible navier stokes equations
      $\nabla \cdot u =0$,
      $ d/dt (u) = -(u \cdot \nabla) u - \nabla p / \rho + f$,
      where here $u$ is the velocity field, $u \cdot \nabla$ is applied
      to each component of $u$ separately, $p$ is the pressure, and $f$ is
      the external force.

    </p>

    <p>
      The external forces are added directly
      via a first order Euler update, and one of the forces is for vorticity,
     which is responsible for the curling effect (ie the formation of
     small vortices) one can observe in real fire. The advection term $(u \cdot \nabla) u$
    is integrated out using the method of characteristics, which generally can
    be used to integrate advection equations of the type
    $d/dt (a) = (v \cdot \nabla) a$ for some velocity field
    $v$ and some function $a$ of space and time. Roughly, the idea is that
    along integral curves of the velocity field the function $a$ will be constant,
    so to set $a(t + d t, x, y, z)$, one must
    follow the velocity field back in time over time span of $dt$,
    say to some point $(x', y', z')$ and then set
    $a(t + dt, x, y, z) = a(t, x, y, z)$. See (Cite Stam) for details. Once we do
    this for each component of the velocity $u$, the
    resulting field must be projected down to its divergence free part in order
    to satisfy incompressibility, and to accomplish this one must solve a poisson type
    boundary value problem for the pressure. The generic methods for doing this involve
    approximating the continuous Laplacian with a discrete graph Laplacian and
    using a fast linear solver to solve the resuling (sparse) linear system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another important idea is that due to a discontinuity in the velocity field
        nearby the boundary, care must be taken when performing the above steps
        at points near the interface. For example, if at some grid position $(i, j, k)$
        in the fuel region I am updating the velocity, the fuel velocities are
        what should be used, but some
        of the neighbors of $(i, j, k)$ may be in the gaseous product region. Thus,
        at these points <i>ghost values</i> of the fuel velocity must be used. Formulas
        for what these ghost values should be can be derived from first principles.
    </p>



  <h3>
    Our simulation algorithm
  </h3>

    <p>
      In order to better understand the algorithm, the shader and texture need to be explained first. The WebGL fragment shader colors our texture by taking a weighted sum of the neighbors' color. This allows the texture to mimic fire by having a more pronounced color on the edges while  the center becomes a lot brighter and whiter. The way the N x N texture is populated for the WebGL shader was by using a pixel N x N array. This pixel array determines whether to color a particular location on the texture depending if its value is 0 (off) or 255 (on). This means that in order to simulate our fire animation, the only thing that needs to be modified is the pixel array. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mutate step works as follows: at particular point in the pixel array, check its status. For each of its neighbors (up, down, left, right), check if they are the opposite. If so, switch the pixel to the opposite status based on a probalility determined by a set of parameters along with a small nudge of randomness. The parameters that determine the probability are <b>Ratio:</b> the main parameter in determining the probability that the pixel will switch, <b>Speed:</b> how fast the fire grows, and <b>Vertical:</b> helps the fire grow up by boosting the probability when checking the neighbor below. 
    </p>
    <p>
      For all the algorithms in the probabilistic implementation, each update step works by calling the mutate function on two groups. The two groups are determined such that each location is not neighbors with any in the same group. This is because each pixel is mutated based on the value of its neighbors, so the two step update prevents previous results from affecting future ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to improve our fire simulation, we attempted to add smoke. This involved updating the fragment shader and the mutate step. In the fragment shader, we placed a barrier around the fire such that if a pixel were to be turned on outside of it, the color would be grey.
